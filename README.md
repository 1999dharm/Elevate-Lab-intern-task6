# 📚 Book Store Sales Analysis Project

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a **SQL-based sales analysis** for a fictional **Book Store**, designed to extract meaningful business insights from raw transactional data. It covers various analytical queries on **books, customers, and orders**, showcasing both technical SQL proficiency and business understanding.

## 🗃️ Database Structure

The project uses three main tables:

- **`books`** – Book details (title, genre, author, price, stock, etc.)
- **`customers`** – Customer information (name, country, city, etc.)
- **`orders`** – Order records (quantity, total amount, order date, etc.)
